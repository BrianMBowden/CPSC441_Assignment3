Compilation: (makefile provided)
    make (compile)
    make clean (remove all compiled files)
    make run (compile and run program)

Execution
    ./MVB

NOTE: 
    if values are changed in the .h file (i.e. the constants) user must "make clean" then "make" for 
    the changes to take place.

Provided is a spreadsheet complete with graphs and tables documenting the testing I performed.
"Chart 1" is the graph of Packet Loss Percentage and Average Wait Time in A Fixed Buffer over Varying Out Speed
"Chart 2" is the Average Delay and Packet Loss in Buffer with Fixed Out Speed over Varying Buffer Size

Also provided is a text file containing some of the raw data collected.

Based on the data collected, the question of varying the buffer size to have the best QoS would imply that
the larger the buffer, the lower the packet loss (exponentially) and the greater the delay time (linearly). 
Therefore, it seems most reasonable to pick a buffer size that has a reasonable packet loss and low wait time. 
Over an 11 Mbps link, it would appear that a larger buffer is the most wise decision, and the point at which
the graphed lines cross look like the option.
This value is around 23000.
